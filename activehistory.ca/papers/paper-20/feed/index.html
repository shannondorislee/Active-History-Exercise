		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps he&#039;s trying to convince himself,.   Just a thought from a mid teenage prairie white boy who attended Canada&#039;s Armed Forces boarding School Equivalent in the early Sixties in Montreal. One of 5800 in Canada between 1954 and 1965.  In exchange for a little education board and room we were treated to experiments carried out by the infamous Allen Clinic of McGill University ,regular armed forces basic training (but running for two years) The result as you may know was the Kubark and current torture manuals used by the CIA and Military extensively in Guantanimo and elsewhere. We were the lucky ones.  Some were  to observe Atomic Bomb Tests up close. 
Oh yes and about the food, the less said the better.  I can assure you our rations and daily meals bore no resemblance to actual Armed Forces food allowances.   I suspect that was just some enterprising cooks who might have traded our food for the slop we ate plus a sweetener. At least that&#039;s what a professional org I belong to thought, when we also were blessed with that same slop at an international event organized in and by by our Montreal  Executive Director (fired) . Like the food quality,  our professional entertainment budget $50,000 at the dinner bought us a Church Choir,!.]]></description>
