		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Abstract Why is Vietnam Recovering, while Cuba is Sinking? Comparing Vietnam and Cuba provides a good lesson in practical economics.  Before both countries adopted similar Soviet political and economic policies, Cuba was much richer than Vietnam. Since 1989, Vietnam took a different approach than the Central and Eastern European ‘big bang’ by slowly ‘liberalizing’ the economic life of each citizen.  This “step by step” policy provides fertile ground to analyse the impact of the key decisions made during this transition. The result of the last 15 years of progression toward more economic liberty is that Vietnam is now far ahead of a paralysed Cuba.
