Canadian Residential School survivor Sheila Wolfleg, talks about her horrific experiences in residential school and of her life afterwards. It was difficult for her to speak about what happened to her with many pauses so frames have been edited for continuity.

Resistance to Residential Schools: Digital Stories

As part of a &quot;Resistance Narratives&quot; project funded by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, the Centre for Youth &#038; Society hired seven Indigenous youth research assistants to create digital stories documenting resistance to the residential school system.

The project, &quot;Residential School Resistance Narratives: Significance and Strategies for Indigneous Youth,&quot; aimed to increase awareness of resistance acts and strategies, and their relevance in today&#039;s context and promote intergenerational healing.

Project coordinator Asma Antoine believes that &quot;this research project has ignited a fire that shows in each digital story. The passion of resistance that validates survival and resilience of First Nations people and communities provides hope for healing and reconciliation over the next generations.&quot;

These videos were presented to family, friends, and guests at UVic and then to a greater public audience as part of the TRC regional conference in April.

Watch the digital stories below, or on YouTube, and find out more about this important project on our research page.]]></description>
