		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sue. 
I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the article.  
Here&#039;s my answers:
-Yes, most historians of Canada are Canadian, drawn to topics by their own past experience, including having the previous generation of Canadian history teachers teaching them. 
-Yes, there are some non-Canadians working as Canadian historians (&#038; many Canadian &#038; non-Canadian historians who touch on Canadian history in their non-Canadian work, &#038; so improve our understanding of it.)
-NO! I&#039;m not enlisting Canadian historians to publish more. (I tend to think we should publish less, but that&#039;s another story.) Instead, I&#039;m enlisting (encouraging? entreating?) them to to write an all-of-Canada, all-of-time Canadian history at least once in their career. I&#039;m arguing that that will a) help them better understand Canada, b) force them to &quot;come clean&quot; beyond the classroom as to what they believe about Canada&#039;s history, c) result in more &#038; spirited &#038; better conversations between Canadian historians, because their work will be more often bumping against each others, and d) ultimately be more relevant &#038; interesting to Canadians today, because by necessity connections will have been made between the deep past &#038; the present, &#038; between all parts of the country.
-To me, Chapters seems a good barometer of the state of Canadian history publishing because the owned-under-one-roof Indigo/Chapters/Coles/SmithBooks together controls so much of the national bookselling market. Public libraries are different, true, but then again they buy mostly the same books as those available at Chapters.  (The 2011-12 Canada history purchases of my local library&#039;s central branch bear this out, I think: http://encore.londonpubliclibrary.ca/iii/encore/search/C__Sd%3A%28canada+history%29+b%3Ace+y%3A%5B2011-2012%5D__Orightresult__U1?lang=eng&#038;suite=cobalt ) There are of course some historians publishing Canadian history who make it into Chapters, but most of that section is dominated by non-historians. That, coupled with the WorldCat stats (Figure 1), suggest that it&#039;s not a case of Canadian historians not publishing (many to academic &#038; small presses, perhaps) ...it&#039;s of Canadian historians not selling.
-Your last questions are fantastic, they&#039;re exactly the questions I think historians are going to have to grapple with. You cite the information age, whereas I cite population, but we&#039;re each saying that things are so fundamentally different now than they were 50, 100, 300 years ago that it calls into question the relevance of all but the most recent history. Here are just 2 top-of-the-head defenses of more distant history:
*I study environmental history / historical geography, &#038; think there&#039;s still lots relevant from the more distant past, &#038; lots that I can convince Canadians is relevant.  Everything from changing ideas of geography (how has our understanding of Canada changed because it&#039;s taken us months&#062;weeks&#062;days&#062;hours to cross its physical space?) to changing environment itself (despite a warmer 20th century, trees haven&#039;t moved north as they had in earlier warm centuries, because we&#039;ve reduced the number of wildlife that help disperse them).   
*We can&#039;t be satisfied with understandings of the more distant past anymore because of the very thing you mention: the  information age. Digital technologies are helping unearth, search, evaluate, and present new historical sources. It&#039;s exciting, it&#039;s fun, &#038; I think the public (publics) will feel the same way, &#038; so will learn new &#038; different things about the more distant past.  
All the best,
Alan]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed reading this article.  Though I am not an historian I do have a couple of questions due to limited knowledge about history and its value.

Are not most people drawn to topics by their own past experience - hence why most historians of Canadian history are Canadians?
Are there non-Canadian working as Canadian historians? 
Is your article simply trying to enlist Canadian historians to publish? 
Do you think what lines a Chapter&#039;s book store the real story about Canadian historian publications?  What about libraries?
Why look back more than 300 years?  What will that history tell us about today?  Would the findings be relevant now in the information age where social and  cultural lives would seem to me to be unrecognizable?
Just wondering and look forward to your responses.
