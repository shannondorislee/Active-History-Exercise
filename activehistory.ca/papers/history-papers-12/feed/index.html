		<description><![CDATA[Washington State U.S.A.
August 9, 2010

The Right Honorable Stephen Harper,
Prime Minister of Canada
24 Sussex Drive at Rideau Gate
Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0A3
Canada 

Subject: Recognition of American Vietnam War era draftees

Prime Minister Harper:

As Prime Minster, you must understand the inherent obligations citizens have to their country. During the United States involvement in the Vietnam War, Canada offered  sanctuary to nearly 50,000 United States men, of military draft age, who refused to honor their moral and legal obligation to their country. Our President, Jimmy Carter, pardoned those men on January 21, 1977 for “…violations of the Military Selective Service Act…” if their actions did not “… involve force or violence”. Many returned to their former country after the pardon.  

In my opinion, the American men who fled to your country, to avoid the Vietnam War era draft, should have applied for conscientious objector status.  However I suspect that few would have qualified. We draftees did what our country expected and needed during a time of war but we have not received any recognition for that service to America. However draft dodgers continue to make the news: It was reported that Castlegar, B.C, in July of 2006, hosted a “Vietnam War Draft-Dodgers Reunion”.  Also at least one United States veteran’s group view Vietnam War draft dodgers as anti-war heroes so draftees have been forgotten. 

Vietnam War draftees, which include men who filled draft dodgers slots, had the moral courage, not shown by the draft dodgers, to serve their country. So I ask you to help in getting some type of formal recognition for the American men who did no need to be pardoned nor did they expect Canada to protect them from their government. 

Your laws made it possible for young American men to avoid their moral and legal obligations to their country.  So it is seems reasonable to ask you for help in honoring the American men who did not use the Canadian government as an aide. My recommendation for an American Conscription Ribbon is enclosed.  

Sincerely,

William Anthony Cook, American Vietnam War Draftee 1965 – Vietnam 1966/67]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suppose Iraqi civilians should also &quot;suck it up&quot;, after all there is a &quot;job&quot; to do.  Without those standing up for personal convictions, this world stands to repeat past mistakes in the following of a naturally fallibly human chain of command.  To argue that one has made a legal commitment (or worse a financial commitment by taking the &quot;king&#039;s shilling&quot;) to a government which outweighs all conceivable scenarios, attempts to simplify the problem by separating humanity from the equation.  A great many progressions in the human race have been in the attempt to keep a complex problem &quot;simple&quot; with constructs later determined to be incomplete.

Regardless of the apparent obligation, do you really want soldiers who aren&#039;t fully committed to their task for one reason or another?  Whether this thinking comes before, or during an enlistment, the risks are the same in a combat role.  Let us at least ensure soldiers are fully committed and willing.

Anyway, the whole argument from warbirdie again overlooks (simplifies) the (obvious) point, that there is apparently an effort to shift the outward facing values of the country, arguably without the support of the majority of people in the country itself.  But I suppose with a shut up and don&#039;t ask questions mentality that might be ok, for some.

This article deserves more comments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey warbirdie, your argument is wrong and it is pathetic.

You never faced her choices, and you never served in Iraq like her.

You should read some international law as well. Iraq War is and was illegal. Get a clue.

		<description><![CDATA[I am sorry, but your argument that she is some sort of victim is completely without merit. She DID volunteer... and she DID take the money and then she just didn&#039;t like the job, so instead of being an adult and sticking it out, she made a run for the border. Not only should she have been deported, she should have been horsewhipped out of the country. 

I don&#039;t have much respect for draft dodgers, but I do respect that they didn&#039;t have a choice about going to war. For them, there wasn&#039;t an option of doing some form of civil service instead. You cannot equate a military deserter with a draftee.

Mrs. Rivera HAD a choice. She joined the army for financial reasons. I will fully admit that the US military functions in some ways as a second welfare system, but that doesn&#039;t change the simple fact that she made the choice to join up. You can call it buyers remorse, but it doesn&#039;T make her  a victim. 

Had Mrs. Rivera been a responsible  adult, she would have served out her contract and left the military. I know plenty of former US soldiers who did just that- many of whom didn&#039;t support the war. Why is she special? Why does she deserve special treatment? Desertion is against american law. You don&#039;t have agree with it, but it isn&#039;t as if Mrs. Rivera had no idea that if she deserted and was caught there would be consequences. She DESERVES a dishonourable discharge. 

Why do you believe she shouldn&#039;t be held accountable for her actions? Because it was war? One cannot even use the argument here that she joined before there was a war, and then a war she didn&#039;t agree with started and so she left. When she joined, the war had been going on for five years.

If you don&#039;t want to be a soldier, don&#039;t put on the uniform. If you take the &#039;King&#039;s Shilling&#039; then suck it up.

To be perfectly honest, I think that calling her a conscientious objector insults every person who suffered under that label in history.]]></description>
